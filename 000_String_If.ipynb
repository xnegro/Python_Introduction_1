    "Python supports different Data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "integer (signed integers):  positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "float (floating point real values): real numbers and are written with a decimal point dividing the integer and fractional parts. Floats may also be in scientific notation, with E or e indicating the power of 10 (2.5e2 = 2.5 x 102 = 250).\n",
    "\n",
    "complex (complex numbers): are of the form a + bJ, where a and b are floats and J (or j) represents the square root of -1 (which is an imaginary number). The real part of the number is a, and the imaginary part is b. Complex numbers are not used much in Python programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean:  The Boolean data type is represented in Python as type bool. It has one of the two values True or False. This type is used to compare two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "String: A string in Python can be created using single, double, and triple quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence Types:\tlist , tuple ,set , dict , range (to be discussed later) \n",
